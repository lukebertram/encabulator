|Term     | Description | Implementation|
|:--------|-------------|--------------:|
|border-box| A value for the 'box-sizing' property that prevents an element's padding and margin values from adding to its total width.| This property value was applied to every element on the page by default by using the * (all) selector at the top of the stylesheet. |
|float| Removes an element from the normal flow of the document, causing it to 'float' either to the left or right depending on the value set.| Both the logo and the navigation links in the page's header are floated - the former to the left and the latter to the right.|
|display: block|Overrides an element's default display style, causing it to display as though it were a block element. By default, block elements take up the full width available and break to their own new line. | |
